function [X, W] = prewhiten(X)
%PREWHITEN Performs prewhitening of a dataset X
%
%   [X, W] = prewhiten(X)
%
% Performs prewhitening of the dataset X. Prewhitening concentrates the main
% variance in the data in a relatively small number of dimensions, and 
% removes all first-order structure from the data. In other words, after
% the prewhitening, the covariance matrix of the data is the identity
% matrix. The function returns the applied linear mapping in W.
